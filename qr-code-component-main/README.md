# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Img tags are inline, which leaves a space to match the height for letters eg: g. If the background colour for an image is something else, the difference in height would be visible. `display:block` should be used to fix this.
- It appears to be a effective method to set the image width to be fluid to match the containers width. For the container size could change for varying screen sizes.
- `min()` css works more or less similar to what `@media` does.
